Exploring the world is part of my life, both by doing research as a PhD student in computer science and on foot in the nature world.
<h2>Piloting</h2>
I'm Private Pilot with Airplane Single Engine Land rating (PP-ASEL). Piloting an aircraft allows me to travel faster and gives me unparalledled opportunities to appreciate the beauty of our world from the air. I've flown to KSBA, KIZA, KCMA, KSBP, KPRB, KVNY, KL52, KMRY, KSBD, and KSZP. I finished my spin recovery training recently.
<h2>Photography</h2>
Iâ€™m a photographer with a homepage on <a href="https://500px.com/danielcliu/">500px.com</a>. Photography allows me to record the beauty of our world, which could be transient.
<h2>Expedition</h2>
I'm a backcountry explorer. I enjoy exploring remote areas to see how wildlives live in their habitats and watch geologic wonders. Some of my favorite destinations include: Arctic Ocean via <a href="https://www.blm.gov/visit/dalton-highway">Dalton Highway</a>, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/the-racetrack.htm">Racetrack Playa</a> via <a href="https://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/standard-road-conditions.htm#unmaintainedroads">Lippincott Road</a>, and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/index.htm">Katmai National Park and Preserve</a>.</li></ul>
