The instructor reserves the right to curve up the final grades in extreme cases.<br />
<br />
<b>Study group</b><br />
<br />
  All homework assignments and course projects are completed by study groups throughout this semester. By the end of the Group Registration deadline, each student must register in a group of 3-5 students. Each group will turn in only one copy of their homework solutions and final project report. Midterm and final presentations are also presented in groups. The assessment point is given to all members in the same group, so students are expected to work closely as a team. However, both midterm and final exams are given individually.<br />
<br />
<b>Homework assignments (32%)</b><br />
<br />
There will be 4 homework assignments and each homework will count 8% toward your final grading. Students should submit homework on time to get full credits. All solutions to homework assignments must be written in <b>LaTeX</b> and submitted in pdf version.<br />
<br />
Late Homework Submission: Homework turned in before or on the specified due date and time, in class or submitted through Brightspace, depending on the circumstance, are eligible for 100% of the grade. If you choose to turn in after the due date and time passes, for the first 24-hour period after the due date and time, your assignment will be eligible for 50% of the full grade; after that, your assignment will be eligible for 0% of the full grade.<br />
<br />
<b>Course projects (13%)</b><br />
<br />
The instructor will provide a list of potential course projects. Each study group may choose to work on one of these projects. Additional course projects beyond the list can also be chosen, subject to approval by the instructor. Throughout the semester, each group will give a midterm presentation, a final presentation (10%), write a final project report (3%), and submit all project code. Students must use Python to complete course projects. Students may lose all 13 points if the code is found to be copied from somewhere or doesn't work at all.<br />
<br />
<b>Exams (50%)</b><br />
<br />
A midterm exam (20%) and a final exam (30%) will be given closed books and individually, so try your best to learn from your group homework assignments!<br />
<br />
<b>Participation (5%)</b><br />
<br />Students are expected to actively engage in this course. Starting Week 2, students who ask questions or voluntarily show/explain their own solutions to in-class exercise problems are eligible for participation points. Eligible students must register their names in person to the instructor to claim these points immediately after each class meeting. Participation points cannot be given online or after the class meeting is fully dismissed. Up to 3 points can be given to each student. The other 2 points are reserved for all students if the percent of submitted course evaluation meets the university policy. However, 0% can be given to students who consistently violate the policies defined below.
<h3>5.2 Final grades</h3>
Final grades are computed based on the above assessment formulas and are NOT negotiable.  Per department policy, ‚Äú‚Ä¶students may not submit additional work or be re-examined for the purpose of improving their grades once the course has been completed and final grades assigned.‚Äù
<h3>5.3 Attendance</h3>
Attendance to all class meetings is required.
<h3>5.4 Withdraw without penalty</h3>
Students need to pay attention to the university calendar to monitor the drop date, which is the last date you can drop this course with no financial consequence. After that, you should consult the university‚Äôs liability schedule to consider dropping from this class. This may happen when you have to miss many assignments for unforeseeable scenarios.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: It is your responsibility to take such an action by this date, and don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs too late to see us when you get in trouble.
<h3>5.5 Incomplete and extra credit policy</h3>
Students must complete all requirements to pass the course. A grade of incomplete will be given only when circumstances beyond the student's control cause a substantial amount of course work to be unfinished by the end of the semester. Whenever possible, the student is expected to make extra efforts to prevent this situation from occurring. A student granted an incomplete will make an agreement specifying what material must be made up, and a date for its completion. The incomplete will be converted to a normal grade on the agreed upon completion date based upon whatever material is submitted by that time. The instructor will be the sole judge of whether an incomplete is warranted.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: Incomplete will not be given to students who have not fulfilled their classwork obligations, and who, at the end of the semester, are looking to avoid failing the course. There will be no extra credit work. All students will be expected to complete, and be graded on, the same set of assignments.
<h3>5.6 Non-class related use of technology</h3>
Use of electronic devices (cell phone, tablets, personal laptop computers) for non-class purposes while the class is in session is not allowed. If this is violated in a consistent manner after initial warning is issued by the instructor, the student involved will be treated as unexcused missing the day‚Äôs class and result in 0% in final participation point.
<h3>5.7 Responsible computing</h3>
Students are required to read the University at Albany Policy for the Responsible Use of Information Technology (https://www.albany.edu/its). Students will be expected to apply the policies discussed in this document to all computing and electronic communications in the course.
<h3>5.8 Students with disabilities</h3>
Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, cognitive, learning and psychiatric disabilities.  If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the Director of the Disability Resource Center. That office will provide the course instructor with verification of your disability, and will recommend appropriate accommodations.  For further information refer to the University‚Äôs Disclosure Statement regarding Reasonable Accommodation.
<h3>5.9 Academic honesty and overall regulations</h3>
Student claims of ignorance, unintentional error, or personal or academic pressures cannot be excuses for violation of academic integrity. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the standards and behaving accordingly, and UAlbany faculty are responsible for teaching, modeling and upholding them. Anything less undermines the worth and value of our intellectual work, and the reputation and credibility of the University at Albany degree.  Plagiarism and other acts of academic dishonesty will be punished. Read the Standards of Academic Integrity and policies in the Undergraduate Bulletin (http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html).<br />
<br />
CAUTION AND A STRONG WORD OF WARNING!!!! Plagiarism and other acts of academic dishonesty will be punished. Students are expected to submit original work in exams. Any student who submits copied work or any student that provides work for copying will earn a zero grade for that exam. If there is more than one copying incident, the student will be graded an F for the class. As per college policy, cheating activity, including cheating in exams, quizzes, projects, etc., WILL be written up in a Violation of Academic Integrity Report (VAIR) reported to the college administration, which includes the Computer Science Chair, the CNSE Dean, and the Vice Provost of Undergraduate Studies. This will become a
part of your permanent record. Multiple incidents will result in being expelled from the university.
<h3>5.10 Student code of conduct</h3>
Student and staff/faculty interactions in the classroom and other on-campus environments are expected to be professional and cordial.  Disruptive behavior in the classroom may be treated by the instructor as a violation of the UAlbany Student Code of Conduct, and subject to a formal Student Conduct Referral.
<h3>5.11 Title IX</h3>
The University at Albany recognizes that in order to maintain a healthy, safe, and vibrant living and learning community, it must continue to foster an environment free from gender inequality and sexual violence. In furthering its commitment to that cause, the University has appointed a full-time administrator to ensure our realization of this important agenda. Further information can be found at the following website: https://www.albany.edu/title-IX.
<h3>5.12 Campus resources to support basic needs</h3>
It is difficult to succeed academically if you don‚Äôt have enough to eat, a safe place to live and sleep, or are struggling with an unforeseen emergency.  Knowing the resources available on your campus to help you succeed is key!  If you need help meeting these or other basic needs, please seek assistance from Supplemental Support Services in the Dean of Students Office. View the basic needs assistance offerings at https://www.albany.edu/dean-students/supplemental-support-services.  While you‚Äôre there, see the variety of helpful services available to you at the Dean of Students at https://www.albany.edu/dean-students.  Contact information can be found on these websites.
