<h1>Biography of <a href="index.html">Chong Liu</a></h1>
<h2>Casual Biography</h2>
I'm a computer scientist working on developing machine learning and optimization algorithms for scientific discovery like drug discovery and math reasoning. I'm also a private pilot and a nature traveler.
<h2>Talk Biography</h2>
Dr. Chong Liu is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the State University of New York at Albany. His research broadly spans machine learning and AI for science, with a focus on Bayesian optimization, drug discovery, quantum machine learning, and math reasoning. His work has been published in leading machine learning venues including ICML, ICLR, AISTATS, UAI, and JMLR, with oral presentations at AAAI and AAMAS. He is an area chair for ICML, ICLR, AISTATS and UAI, an associate editor of IEEE-TNNLS, and he has organized the AI for Drug Discovery and Development (AI4D3) workshop series since 2023. Dr. Liu received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2023 and subsequently spent one year as a Data Science Institute Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago.
