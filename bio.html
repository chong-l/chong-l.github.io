<h1>Biography of <a href="index.html">Chong Liu</a></h1>
<h2>Short Biography</h2>
I'm a DSI Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago hosted by Prof. <a href="https://yuxinchen.org/">Yuxin Chen</a> and Prof. <a href="https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/">Rebecca Willett</a>. Starting Fall 2024, I'll join the University at Albany, State University of New York as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Santa Barbara, advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/">Yu-Xiang Wang</a>. My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning, Optimization and AI for Science, including Bayesian optimization, bandits, active learning, experimental design, materials science, and drug discovery. I'm an editorial board reviewer of JMLR and a program committee member of ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS, AAAI, KDD, and SDM conferences. I'm also the lead organizer of the NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on New Frontiers of AI for Drug Discovery and Development (<a href="https://ai4d3.github.io/index.html">AI4D3-2023</a>).
