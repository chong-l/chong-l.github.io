<h1>My Experiences on 22-23 US Computer Science Faculty Job Market</h1>
<a href="index.html">Chong Liu</a><br />
chongliu.cs@gmail.com<br />
Jan. 1, 2024 in Chicago, IL, USA
<h2>1 About me</h2>
Hi! I'm Chong Liu, currently DSI Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago. I obtained by Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara in June 2023. I joined the 2022-2023 US computer science adademic job market as an All-But-Defense (ABD) Ph.D. candidate. After interviews with many universities, I finally chose to join the State University of New York at Albany as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science starting Fall 2024.<br /><br />
From Nov. 2022 to May 2023, my job search lasted for almost half a year and the whole job search process is not easy, so it seems that I need to write an article sharing my experiences with more current and future job market candidates and beyond. Nowadays, there are a lot of application guides and even statement templates available online, but this article is not intended to be a complete application guide. I just want to share my experiences through my personal perspective, especially to point out some common mistakes for Ph.D. candidate applicants. If you find it useful in some sense, I would be more than happy!

<h2>2 Must know before applying</h2>
<h3>2.1 A rough ranking in descending order of importance</h3>
<ul>
<li>(1) Whether your research area is highly needed > (2) Potential for applying for funds > (3) Publications = (4) Letter of recommendation > (5) Teaching experiences and ability > (6) Academic service (e.g., being a conference chair/organizer)</li>
</ul>
As you can imagine, publications and letters of recommendation play key roles in faculty job applications, but only having them ready is far from enough, because there are more important factors than these two and there are many factors in general. Some job ads In addition to job advertisements that state that various fields of computer science will be considered, many job advertisements will state a specific direction in which they want to recruit, such as artificial intelligence. Such advertisements are usually made by the department for various factors such as scientific research and teaching. The decision on the direction of construction. For such recruitment, applicants who are not generally suitable for the general direction have almost no hope.<br /><br />

Secondly, when applying to be an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, funding is always an unavoidable topic, because it is almost the "food and grass" for scientific research work. Without funds, there is almost no scientific research, so (2) the potential of applying for funds has become the focus of the recruitment committee. items to inspect. However, potential is always a very imaginary concept. How to examine it? It seems like it’s back to paper publications and letters of recommendation, but it’s actually more than that. The experience, knowledge and plan of applying for funds are the magic weapons that stand out from the many doctoral applicants. Specifically, if you are a doctoral student in your final year, you generally don’t have much experience applying for funds. After all, scientific research is the most important task of a Ph.D., and the recruitment committee also understands this. At this time, it is best to have some experience in applying for funds. knowledge and a clear plan. Using the National Science Foundation (NSF) as an example, knowledge is: Which NSF projects (programs) correspond to the direction you are doing? What’s the limit on the number of applications per year? What does NSF Small mean, how much is the amount, and how long does it last? The plan is: What kind of application are you going to submit in your first semester? What is the approximate application plan for the first 2 years and the first 5 years of employment?
 
<h3>2.2 Differences between PhD students and faculty</h3>

From a doctoral student to a novice assistant professor, the difference between the two positions is actually very large. To put it simply, doctoral students almost only need to do scientific research, but teachers need to participate in the entire process of scientific research, including but not limited to applying for funds, doing scientific research, leading students, taking classes and participating in academic services, etc. To use an inappropriate analogy with a company, teachers in the computer department are not only teachers (teaching classes), but also strategic decision-makers (scientific research layout and ideas), administrative management (laboratory construction), technical consultants (teaching students), and sales (making reports) , human resource management (enrollment and recruitment) and social service (reviewing manuscripts, organizing meetings, participating in primary and secondary education) responsibilities. Simply put, teachers in the Department of Computer Science are more like entrepreneurs in academia, and these are deeply reflected in the entire application process.<br />

<h3>2.3 The teaching market is also a market, random and equal</h3>

The teaching job market is essentially a market between job seekers and recruiting units. Since there are more job seekers and more positions in the computer field than in other majors, the entire job search process is full of randomness and even drama. For example, I know that some friends encountered situations where the position was suddenly canceled due to budget changes midway through the interview, and there were also friends who were ranked lower in the rankings and were unable to accept the offer due to various reasons due to a large number of candidates in front of them, so they successfully entered their dream school." Movie plot." In short, it is important to realize that finding a teaching position is random. No matter what happens, you must have a calm mind and respond positively.

Although depending on the year and environment, occasionally job seekers or recruiting departments are stronger, the status of job seekers and recruiting departments is essentially equal. Equivalence here means that when applying, you need to be neither humble nor arrogant. You can neither show arrogance to make the other department think that interviewing you is a waste of time (there must be better choices and will not come here), nor show inferiority (eager for an offer). ). Since you are applying and interviewing, please respect the time spent by both parties and communicate professionally and respectfully.
 
<h3>2.4 Confidence is your key to success</h3>

After the entire process has been completed in half a year, if all the hard skills (things in your resume) cannot be improved in the short term, then self-confidence is your final kick! At any stage of the application process, when competition for positions is extremely close, your confidence is the guarantee of success. The most fearful thing about the entire application process is anxiety and internal friction, especially in the early stages when there is little news. The best thing to do during the interview is to professionally express your interest in the position and your desire to get to know each other, instead of showing panic or low self-esteem because of fear of rejection. , that would be too much of a loss.

<h2>3 Timeline</h2>
Applications for computer teaching positions in the United States are generally divided into four steps. Below I will talk about my experience around these four links.
<ul>
<li>(1) Submit application materials (approximately October to January of the following year)</li>
<li>(2) Video interview (approximately December to March of the following year)</li>
<li>(3) Campus interview (approximately January to April of the following year)</li>
<li>(4) Signing offer (approximately February to May of the following year)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 1: Submit application materials</h3>

I have been reading advertisements since the fall of 2022. The main sources are Computing Research Association (CRA), Academic Jobs Online (AJO) and HigherEdJobs. Basically every advertisement requires at least these application materials:

<b>(1) Resume (CV)</b><br /><br />
Research interests, educational background and publications are the most important and it is best to start writing about them on the first page. In addition to these, you can write about your experience in applying for funds (if any), teaching experience (teaching assistant experience is also counted), honors and awards received, experience in giving reports, academic professional services (such as being a conference chair/journal editor/reviewer) Writers/organizers) and media coverage of social services, etc.

<b>(2) Cover letter</b><br /><br />
This is a very formal application letter that requires standard English letter format. It would be better if it has a header with the logo of your current school or company. The application letter does not need to be long, usually only one page. You need to emphasize all your shining points, from scientific research to teaching. If you have an award-winning paper or something, please highlight it in the application letter. The main purpose of the application letter is to make the other party's recruitment committee interested in you so that they can review your other application materials in detail.

<b>(3) Research statement</b><br /><br />
This is a very important statement, and the content in it will also become questions encountered in subsequent interviews. The general structure includes: an introduction to your research content (it is best to summarize the research you have done in a vivid and story-like framework), a detailed introduction to the research content in your published papers, and a look forward to your future research. Work. It is very important to formulate a large-scale framework with a vivid story. It must be important enough to demonstrate the value of your research, and at the same time clear enough to match the construction direction of the recruiting department. It requires a lot of time to think and polish.

<b>(4) Teaching statement</b><br /><br />
Generally includes three aspects, teaching experience, teaching philosophy, and courses available. For most doctoral students, teaching assistant experience is standard. If you have teaching experience in one class (Guest lecturer) or even one class (Instructor), it will be a good bonus. If there is an evaluation form with positive comments from students That's perfect. The teaching philosophy sounds a bit empty, but in fact it is probably about explaining your understanding of teaching work and how you plan to be a good teacher. The last is the courses that can be taken, which can be written at three levels. The first level is the courses that you are very sure you can take, usually large courses that you have taught yourself or taught as a teaching assistant, such as machine learning for undergraduates. The second level is It is a course that requires simple preparation and can be taken. The third level is a new course that can be offered. This is usually a graduate course based on one's own research direction.

<b>(5) 3 recommendation letters (3 Recommendation Letters)</b><br /><br />
Recommendation letters from the doctoral supervisor and postdoctoral supervisor (if you have postdoctoral experience) are required, and other recommenders should be chosen as familiar as possible (such as collaborators) and from diverse sources (such as schools and companies other than your current unit).<br /><br />

In addition, some advertisements may require a Diversity Statement and more than three letters of recommendation.

<h3>Step 2: Video interview</h3>

After submitting the materials, I slowly waited for the video interview. The waiting process was very long and very anxious. In addition, it was also the early stage of my postdoc application, and there was no news from both the teaching position and the postdoc. I thought I was going to lose my job, but later I found out that this The mentality is very bad. Fortunately, I got my first video interview very quickly. When I got my first interview, I felt like I was facing an enemy. I searched for various channels and resources. My overall feeling is as follows:<br /><br />

(1) First of all, being able to get a video interview means that your background has passed the test, because the selection committee is only interested in you after seeing your hard materials, so this interview is held, so you must have confidence in yourself, and start from a simple In terms of hard power, you are already qualified to be colleagues with everyone! This is the context for video interviews.<br /><br />

(2) The purpose of the video interview is that the recruitment committee wants to see a more three-dimensional version of you, that is, it wants to see what you look like outside of your resume. Therefore, in the video interview, unless the other party requests it, do not repeatedly mention things that have been shown in your resume. For example, repeatedly emphasizing how great your paper is will make the other party think that you are eager for an offer, and will act more powerful than you. Be strong and you will lose the initiative. Instead, demonstrate your grace, wit, strong will, and determination during the video interview.<br /><br />

(3) The next level of the video interview is the campus interview. Please prepare some reasons that will make the recruitment committee feel that you must come to the campus for the interview! This often requires you to do some homework, find out what the other department, school, local and state big strategic plans are, and use your background to convince them that you are one of the most suitable candidates. Please note that "most suitable" is the most important here, and it is often not the strongest candidates who get the interview.<br /><br />

After the first video interview, I felt much less stressed, not because I felt like I had done well in the interview, but because I was familiar with the entire video interview process and became much calmer mentally. Later, I interviewed at several schools one after another.
 
<h3>Step 3: campus interview</h3>

My first on-campus interview was with an eastern university. The campus interview is the most important step in the entire application process, because after the campus interview you decide whether to make an offer or not.<br /><br />

A typical campus interview process is:<br /><br />

<b>(1) 8-10am</b>: the department chair will have breakfast with you at the hotel and then take you around the campus.<br /><br />
Note that the interview starts as soon as you meet each other. Breakfast and walking around campus are also suitable for talking about some lighter topics. At this step, it is most important to establish a good impression on each other, and you can relax a little and prepare for the next interview. By the way, I have a 3-hour time difference from California to the East for my interview, and 8am in the local area is equivalent to 5am in California. Imagine what it would be like to get up early in the morning and interview for 12 hours straight! But there’s nothing you can do about it, haha. You can drink more coffee at breakfast! Of course, those who are willing can also adjust the time difference by themselves in advance.<br /><br />

<b>(2) 10-11am</b> allows you to give a report to the entire department (job talk)<br /><br />
This is the most important step in the campus interview. There are three reasons: (a) all the teachers in the department will make a preliminary evaluation of your scientific research level from this hour, (b) many of the questions you will encounter in the subsequent interview are also the same. From this report, (c) this is one of the few opportunities to examine the level of teaching.<br /><br />

Therefore, no amount of preparation for this report can be overdone. I recommend that you write your ppt as early as possible and invite everyone you can find, including teachers, classmates, and even laypeople who only know English, to listen to your practice, because your audience will also be very diverse. , the questions received were also varied, and they were revised iteratively. I have changed about 9 versions of my own ppt and practiced it dozens of times. I even heard that some students bought a full-length mirror and practiced crazily in front of the mirror.<br /><br />

At the same time, when making a ppt, you must take into account both breadth and depth. The best effect is to make the vast majority of the audience understand your scientific research content and feel it is very important, and at the same time, make a small number of teachers in the same direction feel that your scientific research is novel and profound. The former can tell stories starting from actual application scenarios and interspersed with several humorous points and interactive question sessions. The latter needs to show real technical details in a very short time (no more than 5 minutes) and repeatedly emphasize innovation points and corresponding practical applications. Significance of the outcome in the scenario.<br /><br />

<b>(3) 11am-12pm</b> Have two 1:1 30min meetings with faculty members<br /><br />
On the day of the interview, there will be many arrangements for one-on-one meetings and chats with teachers, usually focusing on scientific research. If you meet teachers from the same direction, please actively seek their support. If you meet teachers from different directions, please You can talk about whether there are any opportunities for cooperation, or you can easily talk about things other than scientific research, such as teaching.<br /><br />

<b>(4) 12-1:30pm</b>, the other two teachers will take you out for a simple lunch.<br /><br />
Like breakfast, lunch is also an interview, but the department head usually does not participate in this step, usually together with two teachers in the department. Different from a meeting, you can talk about some lighter topics during the meal, such as talking about local housing prices and education levels, but it is also quite common to have very technical scientific research discussions.<br /><br />

<b>(5) 1:30-2pm</b> Meeting with the dean at 1:30pm<br /><br />
This link is more suitable for the dean to understand the situation of the school and college from a macro perspective. At the same time, the dean will also have a general understanding of what kind of teaching candidate you are. Questions usually asked to the dean include: the school’s financial resources (if it is a public school, the state government’s investment), the school’s strategic plan (for example, UAlbany recently had a very ambitious AI research and investment plan), and the college’s teacher recruitment plan , as well as the source of students in the college and the destination of students after graduation, etc.<br /><br />

<b>(6) 2-2:30pm</b> meeting with department administrative staff (staff)<br /><br />
This link is suitable for asking the department to learn about the office environment and computing resources of the laboratory, etc.<br /><br />

<b>(7) 2:30-4:30pm</b>, have a half-hour meeting with four other teachers.<br /><br />
This step is similar to step (3).<br /><br />

<b>(8) 4:30-5:30pm</b> meeting with the department chair<br /><br />
It is usually a one-hour meeting. The department chair will reconfirm your interest in the position and introduce all aspects of the position, including salary and benefits, conditions for tenure, research expectations, teaching tasks, and campus. Department and Social Services, etc., and the department chair will take your questions.<br /><br />

<b>(9) 5:30-8pm</b>, the other two teachers will take you out for dinner, and then send you back to the hotel at about 8pm<br />
This step is similar to step (4).<br /><br />

The whole process lasted about 12 hours, and I met at least 12 teachers. Remember that the interview was still not over after returning to the hotel! Please remember to send customized thank-you letters to the dean, department chair, and teachers with whom you have talked more! This is not only to show your interest to the other party again, but it is also the first lesson in workplace etiquette!<br />

<h3>Step 4: Signing the contract</h3>

The last step is to sign the contract! Offers are generally received within two weeks (first batch) to two months (Nth batch) after the campus interview. The choice of this step varies from person to person. Common considerations include: the level and construction status of the department's platform, salary, start-up funding for scientific research, geographical location, climate, family factors, etc. It should be noted that teaching is a job after all, and you will live there for a long time. Therefore, my observation shows that when making a choice at this step, the weight of the last three factors is significantly greater than when applying for a Ph.D.<br />
