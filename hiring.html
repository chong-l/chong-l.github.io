<h2>About me</h2>
I’m Chong Liu, an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://www.albany.edu/computer-science">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/">State University of New York at Albany (UAlbany)</a> starting Fall 2024. Before that, I received my PhD in <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">UC Santa Barbara</a> in 2023. Currently I’m a <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/">Data Science Institute</a> Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>. My publications mainly appear in top machine learning conferences and journals like ICML, AAAI, AISTATS, UAI, and JMLR. I’m the <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/editorial-board.html">editorial board reviewer</a> of JMLR and the lead organizer of the NeurIPS-2023 Workshop on New Frontiers of AI for Drug Discovery and Development (<a href="https://ai4d3.github.io/">AI4D3-2023</a>).<br /><br />
My research interests are Machine Learning and AI for Science:
<ul>
  <li>Bayesian optimization</li>
  <li>Bandit algorithms</li>
  <li>Active learning</li>
  <li>Experimental design</li>
  <li>AI for materials science and drug discovery</li></ul>
I’m looking for two CS PhD students to join my lab at UAlbany starting Fall 2024. Both positions will be fully funded. More information can be found on my <a href="https://chong-l.github.io/">personal homepage</a> and <a href="https://www.albany.edu/computer-science/programs/phd-computer-science">CS PhD program website</a>.
<h2>What will I provide as a PhD advisor?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fully funded CS PhD positions.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive, patient, and responsible research training.</li>
  <li>Friendly study and research environment and abundant computing resources.</li>
  <li>Strong support for collaborations, internships, award nomination, job hunting, and career development.</li></ul>
<h2>What do I expect from you?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be responsible and stay self-motivated. They are essential for you PhD student to navigate the inherent uncertainty of research, enabling you to stay focused and achieve success.</li>
  <li>Be curious and be able to think in depth. Given a new idea that you are interested in, are you happy to dig into it?</li>
  <li>Math background (statistics, probability, linear algebra) and coding skills (programming languages and ML/AI developing tools).</li>
  <li>Bachelor’s degree (or higher) in computer science, math, statistics, operations research, electrical engineering, or related areas.</li></ul>
<h2>Why UAlbany CS?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Founded in 1967, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/computer-science">UAlbany CS</a> has a rich history with two Turing Award laureates (an alumni and a faculty member).</li>
  <li>Current <a href="https://www.albany.edu/computer-science/faculty-staff">CS faculty team</a> is small but prestigious, including 4 NSF CAREER Award winners.</li>
  <li>AI research at UAlbany is going strong! In 2022, there is <a href="https://www.albany.edu/president/albany-artificial-intelligence-supercomputing-initiative">$75 million</a> funding support from the New York State, specifically for AI research at UAlbany, to recruit <a href="https://www.albany.edu/news-center/news/2022-ualbany-launches-massive-artificial-intelligence-cluster-hire-27-faculty">27 faculty members</a> in AI and build a supercomputing center. By Aug. 2023, 18 positions have been filled and I’m one of them. In Oct. 2023, UAlbany and IBM announced new <a href="https://www.albany.edu/news-center/news/2023-ualbany-ibm-announce-new-20m-ai-research-collaboration">$20 million</a> AI research collaboration.</li>
  <li>Albany and its nearby region, known as the capital region, is now the research center of semiconductor and AI in the US with many collaboration and internship opportunities. In Aug. 2023, the prestigious Albany NanoTech Complex has officially <a href="https://www.albany.edu/news-center/news/2023-ualbany-launches-college-nanotechnology-science-engineering">returned</a> to <a href="https://www.albany.edu/cnse">UAlbany CNSE</a>, the home college of UAlbany CS. Also, IBM Research AI Hardware Center and GlobalFoundries Manufacturing Center are in capital region.</li></ul>
<h2>Why Albany, NY?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As the capital city of the New York State, Albany is a mid-size city where you can enjoy both convenient city life and comfortable country life.</li>
  <li>Albany has a lot of living resources but low cost.</li>
